- <h3 align="left">Training Procedure</h3>
> We chose VGG16 model as one of the simpleset feed-forward convolutional neural network, and implemented the training procedure, exactly with the same details described in its [<ins>official paper</ins>](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) in the Python and under tensorflow and keras frameworks.
