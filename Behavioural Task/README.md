<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

> - In this task, the idea was Investigating cognitive mechanisms underlying visual, auditory, body-related information processing and sensorimotor learning. We sought healthy volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing to participate in a study that investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual and/or auditory processing, human sensorimotor learning, processing of body-related information and how such information modulates perception and action. The tasks ran online via [<ins>Pavlovia</ins>](https://pavlovia.org/) and [<ins>Qualtrics</ins>](https://www.qualtrics.com). 

> - The task was looking at every image and type what you see in a few words. The items that are reported can actually be present in the image or feels like have been saw !!! Some just colored images also put for having "catch trial". There was only 10 seconds to look at each image and typing the words. Also, it has been asked them not to write more than 5 words and try to be as fast and accurate as possible; below are the some sample images from the task in our 3 categories:

<h2 align="left">Results</h2>

> - By analyzing responses to images, from general filters (every responses that is related to human and human faces in anyway, like face elements, emotions, occubations, genders, ...) to more specific filters for just human face components and up to strictly just the 'face' word, the number of face-related-word's encounters (times that a word has passed our filters), has gradualy become less for real faces and more for illusory faces (pareidolia) images on the contrary.

This means that.
