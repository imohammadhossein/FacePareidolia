<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

In this task, the idea was Investigating cognitive mechanisms underlying visual, auditory, body-related information processing and sensorimotor learning. We sought healthy volunteers with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing to participate in a study that investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual and/or auditory processing, human sensorimotor learning, processing of body-related information and how such information modulates perception and action. The tasks ran online via Pavlovia (pavlovia.org) and Qualtrics (qualtrics.com).
